<p>Yes. Designers who sit within a feature team gain large advantages if they can code. Here are three reasons why.</p>
<h2>Shared vocabulary</h2>
<p>It creates a &quot;shared vocabulary between engineering and design&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. When engineers talk about changes that need to be made and shipping fixes to customers, the design team are no longer left scratching their heads.</p>
<h2>Tickets are done quicker</h2>
<p>Everyone does code reviews. Designers now get hands-on when reviewing pull requests, requesting and reviewing screenshots/gifs and sitting with engineers to desk-review implementations. They’re now creating their own pull requests.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<h2>Small changes are no longer blocked by busy engineers</h2>
<p>I would be more effective if I didn't have to wait for other people... ...I ended up becoming more effective because I was able to ship the small things and fix bugs myself. Text changes. Translations file. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
