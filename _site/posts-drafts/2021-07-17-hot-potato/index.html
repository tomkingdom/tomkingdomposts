<p>In &quot;The Hot Potato Process,” Dan Mall <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> challenges the traditional one-way handoff between designers and developers, advocating instead for a truly collaborative workflow.</p>
<p>Rather <em>than perfecting designs before passing</em> them to developers, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> Mall suggests ideas should be “passed quickly back and forth from designer to developer and back to designer then back to developer for the entirety of a product creation cycle.” This “Hot Potato Process” fosters better outcomes through constant iteration and communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... great collaboration follows what Brad Frost and I call “The Hot Potato Process,” where ideas are passed quickly back and forth from designer to developer and back to designer then back to developer for the entirety of a product creation cycle. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mall emphasizes that collaboration isn’t limited to co-located teams—remote teams can use video chat and asynchronous recordings to maintain a real-time, interactive dynamic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the article argues that “working together means working together,” no matter where team members are located.</p>
