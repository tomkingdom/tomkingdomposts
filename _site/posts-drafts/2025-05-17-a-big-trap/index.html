<p>Big trap: Believing that certain<br>
people are successful because of<br>
what they know and you don't Vs<br>
the fact that they've practiced<br>
something you know<br>
The reason that there are a million<br>
derivative and largely similar<br>
frameworks in product... Is that it<br>
is way easier to believe it's a<br>
knowledge problem than a<br>
practice, motivation or<br>
environment problem.</p>
