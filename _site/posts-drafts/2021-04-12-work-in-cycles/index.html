<blockquote>
<p>Once you’re happy with the basic design, <strong>make it real</strong>. You’ll probably run into some unexpected complexity along the way, but that’s the point — <strong>it’s a lot easier to fix design problems in an interface you can actually use than it is to imagine every edge case in advance</strong>. Iterate on the working design until there are no more problems left to solve,</p>
