<p>One of the promises of technology is omnipresence, the ability to be everywhere at the same time. Technology such as WhatsApp allows me immediate communication with friends across the world; at a moments notice a friend who lives miles away can call my attention, at any time.</p>

<p>Gather, a tool we use at work does exactly this.</p>
<p>This is why my domain has opening times and is geographically limited to places that I live in.</p>
