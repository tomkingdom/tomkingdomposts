    <h1>The Hot Potato Process</h1>
<p>In “The Hot Potato Process,” Dan Mall <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> challenges the traditional one-way handoff between designers and developers, advocating instead for a truly collaborative workflow.</p>
<p>Rather than perfecting designs before passing them to developers, Mall suggests ideas should be “passed quickly back and forth from designer to developer and back to designer then back to developer for the entirety of a product creation cycle.” This “Hot Potato Process” fosters better outcomes through constant iteration and communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... great collaboration follows what Brad Frost and I call “The Hot Potato Process,” where ideas are passed quickly back and forth from designer to developer and back to designer then back to developer for the entirety of a product creation cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mall emphasizes that collaboration isn’t limited to co-located teams—remote teams can use video chat and asynchronous recordings to maintain a real-time, interactive dynamic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the article argues that “working together means working together,” no matter where team members are located.</p>
