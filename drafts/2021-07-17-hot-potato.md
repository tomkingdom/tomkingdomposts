title: The Hot Potato Process

In "The Hot Potato Process,” Dan Mall [^1] challenges the traditional one-way handoff between designers and developers, advocating instead for a truly collaborative workflow. 

Rather *than perfecting designs before passing* them to developers, [^2] Mall suggests ideas should be “passed quickly back and forth from designer to developer and back to designer then back to developer for the entirety of a product creation cycle.” This “Hot Potato Process” fosters better outcomes through constant iteration and communication.

> ... great collaboration follows what Brad Frost and I call “The Hot Potato Process,” where ideas are passed quickly back and forth from designer to developer and back to designer then back to developer for the entirety of a product creation cycle. [^3]



Mall emphasizes that collaboration isn’t limited to co-located teams—remote teams can use video chat and asynchronous recordings to maintain a real-time, interactive dynamic. 

Ultimately, the article argues that “working together means working together,” no matter where team members are located.
