Big trap: Believing that certain
people are successful because of
what they know and you don't Vs
the fact that they've practiced
something you know
The reason that there are a million
derivative and largely similar
frameworks in product... Is that it
is way easier to believe it's a
knowledge problem than a
practice, motivation or
environment problem.
