title: Deliberate Delays
---

One of the promises of technology is omnipresence, the ability to be everywhere at the same time. Technology such as WhatsApp allows me immediate communication with friends across the world; at a moments notice a friend who lives miles away can call my attention, at any time.  

It's fascinating to see some technology making a concerted effort to build in delays and slowness. This makes their products feel, in a way, more human.

Gather, a tool we use at work does exactly this.

This is why my domain has opening times and is geographically limited to places that I live in.
