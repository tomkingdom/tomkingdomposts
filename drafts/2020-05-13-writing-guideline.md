semicolon

If you have two independent clauses, meaning they could stand alone as their own sentences, it’s ok to use a semicolon.

Don’t use it with conjunctions \(words like and, but, or, nor, for, so and yet\).  
My aunt’s hairy knuckles are magnificent indeed, but I have no desire to stroke them.
