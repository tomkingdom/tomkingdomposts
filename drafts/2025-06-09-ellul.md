title: Jacques Ellul on Product Development

1. The Primacy of "Means" over "Ends"
In pre-modern times, tools were secondary to human goals (e.g., a hammer is used to build a house). Ellul argued that in a technological society, we have become so obsessed with the methods (the means) that we have forgotten the reasons (the ends).

The Vacuum of Purpose: If you don't know why you are doing something, Technique provides the how. It fills the void with a ready-made goal: Efficiency.

The Trap: If you have no higher purpose, you will naturally choose the "one best way" (the most efficient path) because it seems logical. In doing so, you stop being a "deciding human" and start being a "functioning component."
