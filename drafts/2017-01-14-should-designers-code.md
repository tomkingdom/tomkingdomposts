title: Should Designers Code?
---

Yes. Designers who sit within a feature team gain large advantages if they can code. Here are three reasons why.

## Shared vocabulary

It creates a "shared vocabulary between engineering and design"[^1]. When engineers talk about changes that need to be made and shipping fixes to customers, the design team are no longer left scratching their heads.

## Tickets are done quicker 

Everyone does code reviews. Designers now get hands-on when reviewing pull requests, requesting and reviewing screenshots/gifs and sitting with engineers to desk-review implementations. They’re now creating their own pull requests.[^2]

## Small changes are no longer blocked by busy engineers 

I would be more effective if I didn't have to wait for other people... ...I ended up becoming more effective because I was able to ship the small things and fix bugs myself. Text changes. Translations file. [^2]
