## Person

From early-stage exploratory research to building design systems, and from branding to growth experiments, I cover the entire spectrum of design practice required for product development. This breadth of experience enables me to strategize and deliver high-level results throughout an organization.

Currently I work in Munich for [FTAPI](https://www.ftapi.com), a data transfer platform.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-kingdom-041212142/) or get in touch at [t@tomkingdom.com](mailto:t@tomkingdom.com).


## Posts

The writing and ideas collected here, all of which are loosely associated with product development and design, are those that I found helpful and thus want to remember. 

Recording them publicly forces me to both clarify and engage more earnestly. It also serves as an easy reference point to colleagues and friends.
