title: 70-20-10
---

My colleague [Johannes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannes-gerhardt/) recently mentioned the so called "70-20-10" rule in passing. Here is a quick breakdown.

It was initially developed to guide how people learn and grow at work.[^1] The researchers surveyed nearly 200 successful executives, asking them to identify the key events in their careers that made them more effective leaders. Based on the responses, they distilled the learning process into three categories:

| Percentage | Type of Learning | Description |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| 70% | Challenging Assignments | "On-the-job" experience, solving problems, and handling new responsibilities. |
| 20% | Developmental Relationships | Learning through others (mentors, bosses, feedback, and observation). |
| 10% | Coursework & Training | Formal education, seminars, and reading. |

In the early 2000s, Eric Schmidt[^2] adapted the learning ratio into a strategic framework to ensure Google didn't lose its innovative edge while scaling its massive search business.

| Percentage | Type of Work | Description | Examples |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 70% | Core Business | To sustain and improve the primary revenue drivers. | Search, AdWords, Infrastructure. |
| 20% | Adjacent Emerging Stars | To scale products that have shown promise but aren't yet "core." | Google Drive, Maps, Gmail (in their early years). |
| 10% | Radical Innovative Moonshots | To explore high-risk, high-reward ideas for the distant future. | Waymo (Self-driving), Project Loon, AlphaGo. |
